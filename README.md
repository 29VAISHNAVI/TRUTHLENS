TRUTHLENS-Fake News Detection
This project implements a Machine Learning–based Fake News Detection system using Natural Language Processing techniques. The model is trained on a real-world dataset of news titles, where text preprocessing, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization are applied. A Logistic Regression classifier is used to distinguish between fake and real news.

The trained model is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application, allowing users to paste news headlines and instantly detect whether the news is fake or real.
